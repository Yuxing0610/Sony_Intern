## Next step

- already implemented Memory augmented optimizer of the original version and the version that only store a random key

- try to see if we can get a buffer with more historical info

- try to implement this method on BNN, since there are cliiping operations when using BNN after every iteration, it can resist the instability of the forward-mode autodiff method
